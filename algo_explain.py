    When the server starts, it initializes several components:
    - **Legitimate traffic tracker**: Tracks legitimate DNS requests using RHHH.
    - **Attack tracker**: Tracks suspicious or malicious DNS requests using RHHH.
    - **Counters**: The algorithm uses counters to track how many packets have been processed so far and how many of them were identified as attacks.
    - **Thresholds**: Various thresholds are set, such as the ratio of non-existent domain (NXD) queries that might indicate an attack.

    - **Legitimate vs Malicious**:
      The algorithm compares how frequently a source appears in the legitimate traffic tracker versus the attack tracker.
      - If the algorithm is in the "under attack" state, it checks if the ratio between the attack tracker of the source and the legitimate tracker is greater than the `lower_attack_threshold_ratio` (defined by the user).
      - If the algorithm is not in the "under attack" state, it checks if the ratio between the attack tracker of the source and the legitimate tracker is greater than the `upper_attack_threshold_ratio` (defined by the user).

    For every DNS packet received:
    1. **Check legitimacy**: If the algorithm decides to allow the packet, it is forwarded to the DNS resolver, which returns the decision on whether the packet is legitimate or a potential NXD attack.
    2. **Update trackers**: 
       - If legitimate, the packetâ€™s source is logged in the legitimate traffic tracker.
       - If malicious (NXD), the source is added to the attack tracker.
    3. **Update Ccunters**: Our algorithm updates internal counters such as the total number of queries and NXDs.
